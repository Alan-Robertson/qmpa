A basic library for quantum multi-precision arithmetic circuits. 

Provides gate counts and implementations for adders (Cuccero ripple carry adder), subtraction (inverse ripple carry), integer multiplication (shift and add on ripple carry) and integer division (trial subtraction long division). 

Also provides output in the form of quantikz diagrams.
